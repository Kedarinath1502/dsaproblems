'''
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
node of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q 
as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
